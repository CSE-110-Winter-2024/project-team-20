# Team X - Successorator

For Iteration 1 of MS1, we had an expected count of 14.5 person hours of work, but it ended up taking us 18 hours of actual work ( given that some of our tasks overflowed into iteration 2).
For Iteration 2 of MS1, we also had an expected count of 14.5 person hours of work, but this ended up taking us 24 hours of actual work (we had to finish some overflowed tasks and do some final checking).

Taking both of these into account, we get 14.5/18 = 0.806 as a velocity for Iteration 1 and 14.5/24 = 0.604   as a velocity for Iteration 2, but given that these numbers are misrepresented due to overflow of unfinished tasks into Iteration 2 from Iteration 1, we calculate the velocity for the milestone and get (14.5+14.5)/(18+24) = 0.69. Given that this velocity is approximately the same as our initially planned velocity of 0.7 and given our recent experience with milestone, agile software development, we choose to continue onward, keeping a velocity of 0.7 for Iteration 1 of Milestone 2 as well.
